Part 1: Basic QA questions

Q1 
Attached in the email (patient.json) is an example FHIR message used to transfer patient information (in JSON format). There are multiple errors within the file. Please identify and fix as many errors as possible within the JSON. List out what changes you made and attach a fixed version back.

Q2 
Write at least 3 unit tests (any language, can be pseudo code) for the below javascript function:

var fizzBuzz : function( test ){
  if ( test % 3 === 0 ){
   	return 'Fizz';
  } else if (test % 5 === 0 ){
	return 'Buzz';
  }
  return '';
}

Part 2: Open ended QA questions

Q3
Given a basic scheduling software system for patient appointments that sends out emails 24 hours before the scheduled time to the patient email as a reminder. Describe some tests you would write to ensure things were working and scenarios that you might attempt to break the system.

Organization name:
Gender:
Number of conditions they have: 
List of all conditions:
